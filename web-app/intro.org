* Introduction
  
  Through the course of this project, we need to build a web
  application, ground up to the cloud.  We need to go through an
  end-to-end requirements.

* Goal
  
  Gathering the requirements

** Requirements gathering
   We need to document the requirements of the user/customer. These
   need to be established as early as possible, so as to ensure that
   the end application is what the customer wants.
   
* Components of a web application

** Front-end component
   We need to build the front-end of the application, which will be
   the interface for the user to interact with the application. The
   front-end is essentially the interface between the user and the
   server.
   
** Server-side component
   The server-side component will service the requests from the
   front-end user component. This component ensures that whatever
   data the front-end component requests will be serviced accurately
   and as soon as possible, from the database.

* Relational data model

** What we've learnt so far
   So far, we've learnt to model the entities in a system into
   relations, so that we can manipulate data in the system.

   We've learnt about isolating entities of a system, in order to
   depict the states of the system.

   We've learnt about representing functions in terms of the
   cardinalities.

   We've learnt about cardinalities of entities, and how to use these
   cardinalities in order to model relations.

   Cardinalities:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   
   
   B*-----> 0 or more

   B+-----> atleast 1

   B!-----> exactly 1

   B?-----> at most 1

   #+END_EXAMPLE

   We've also learnt about system states, and how to use cardinalities
   to model these system states in order to depict the complete
   working state of a system.

   Using cardinalities enables us to accurately depict the system
   states, either relationally or graphically.
   
   We've also learnt about relational intergrity of the relations in
   a system.
